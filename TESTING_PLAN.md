## Critical Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Drug Sale with Stock Validation
```php
// Test Case: Attempt to sell more drugs than available
Given: Drug batch has 10 units available
When: User attempts to sell 15 units
Then: System should prevent the sale and show error message
```

### Scenario 2: Expired Drug Handling
```php
// Test Case: Prevent sale of expired drugs
Given: Drug batch expired yesterday
When: User attempts to include it in a sale
Then: Batch should not appear in available options
```

### Scenario 3: FIFO Stock Management
```php
// Test Case: Ensure FIFO implementation
Given: Two batches of same drug with different expiry dates
When: User creates a sale
Then: System should suggest batch with earlier expiry first
```

### Scenario 4: Invoice Calculation Accuracy
```php
// Test Case: Verify invoice total calculation
Given: Multiple items with different quantities and prices
When: Invoice is generated
Then: Line totals and grand total should be mathematically correct
```

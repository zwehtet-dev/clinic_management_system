# Filament Relation Managers - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

I have created comprehensive relation managers for the clinic management system to enhance the user experience and provide better data management capabilities. These relation managers allow users to manage related data directly from the parent resource view.

## ðŸ“‹ Relation Managers Created

- âœ… Doctor selection with search functionality
- âœ… Visit type badges (consultation, follow-up)
- âœ… Status badges (pending, completed, cancelled)
